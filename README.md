# Balancer

This program is designed to simplify the balancing of units in mods for the game Star Wars Empire at War: Force of Corruption.

It allows you to visualize the various characteristics of game units in the form of tables and graphs in order to simplify the balancing of these units relative to each other.

The program parses the specified XML-files, determines records about units in them and visualizes the data.

At the moment, the program is actively supplemented with new functionality.

I hope over time this will become a useful tool for the Empire at War modding community.
